# VDX: Project 4JD UI

### An legacy console UI design for MC Win10 Bedrock.

#### Description ####

Is an testing TP that would change some UI, and the goal of this project is convert from default UI to high accuracy 4JD (Legacy Console) UI TP for Bedrock Edition users, replacing some designs to look more similar!

The UI design was originally made by Julie "Danger" Kennedy from 4J Studios! I simply recreate the UI port for Bedrock Edition ;D.

For now it will be designated only for PC Windows 10 or Consoles.

For mobile (Mini version) it will be available for late 2021.

#### License ####

This project will be open source and under the GNU GPL v3.0.

If you have more questions about this, let me know by MD on my twitter @CrisXolt.

#### Rules to test ####

Note: The only prerequisite before testing is that you make sure you have a Windows 10 PC. Otherwise, the bug report will be completely ignored (So, don't do it if you have mobile device).

At the moment, only the following can be done:
- Test and report bugs.
- 

You can't:
- Redistribute the master (current) version to other pages.
- Make previews. (Not yet)
