# VDX: Project 4JD UI

### An legacy console UI design for MC Win10 Bedrock.

#### Description ####

Is an testing TP that would change some UI, and the goal of this project is convert from default UI to high accuracy 4JD (Legacy Console) UI TP for Bedrock Edition users, replacing some designs to look more similar!

The UI design was originally made by Julie "Danger" Kennedy from 4J Studios! I simply recreate the UI port for Bedrock Edition ;D.
